                    <p>This is my gaming rig which I have been using for a couple of months. It has been serving me well, pumping out 240fps, on the games I am currently playing.</p>

<h1 id="gabriels-gaming-rig">Gabriel’s Gaming Rig</h1>

<p>I started designing my pc months before I had anywhere near the money that I needed to build it. I was always using pcpartpicker and constantly changing things. My base build was a Ryzen 7 2700X with a GTX 1660 which wasn’t a very smart choice for a gaming build as I wouldn’t be able to utilise all 8 cores. It was especially bad when the price of the Ryzen 5 2600 was so much cheaper while sacrificing very little single-thread performance. Another problem was that I spent too much on the CPU in a gaming build as opposed to the GPU. I am aware that the Ryzen 5 3600 does also seem a bit overkill however the value was/is too good to ignore and was/is still cheaper than the Ryzen 7 2700X.</p>

<h2 id="ryzen-5-3600">Ryzen 5 3600</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/ryzen_3600.jpg" alt="3600" /></p>

<p>The Ryzen 3600 is an amazing CPU for the price having 6 cores and 12 threads with a base clock of 3.6GHz and a turbo boost of up to 4.2GHz. Is has 32mb of cache which is great for gaming. I chose the Ryzen 5 3600 because it’s immense value is almost incomparable with any CPU in the same price range. Its single-threaded performance is very good making it great for me as I am primarily using it for gaming. However, it is still a Hexa-core processor meaning it is still strong in other areas such as editing, which I also do on occasion. So far it has served me well. however, I have had a few minor setbacks with it. The processor I received does not reach the advertised turbo boost maxing out at 4.08GHz. When overclocking to over 4.1GHz I get stuck in a boot loop. I have tried some fixes such as flashing the motherboard bios. Unfortunately, I have gotten little success. One thing I am yet to try is reinstalling the chipset drivers. If that works I will update this post. Minus the issues my overall experience has been good and would recommend it to anyone building a midrange custom PC.</p>

<h2 id="vega-56">Vega 56</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/vega_56.jpg" alt="vega 56" /></p>

<p>The Vega 56 is a great card for being released in 2017. I bought a refurbished Gigabyte OC version which comes with 3 display ports and 3 HDMI ports. It is manually overclocked to 1501MHz clock speed and 800Mhz memory clock. It comes with 8GB of VRAM which is more than enough for any modern title. Paired with my CPU it pumps out 240fps in games such as Overwatch, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Destiny 2 in 1080p. Although this means I have to play at low settings to achieve this I value hitting 240fps and getting full value out of my 240hz monitor over the game looking better. However, this does not mean that it is not capable of running 60fps on max settings if you prefer that. The card does get quite hot and draws a lot of power getting up to 75°C+ when overclocking. The power consumption can be an issue as spikes in power can cause the pc to crash. To avoid this make sure you use two separate 8 pin connectors to power the GPU. This will require at least a semi-modular power supply. The card can also get quite loud when running full wack so if you do not want a loud card either make sure you have some seriously good airflow or refrain from buying this card. Other than the crashes my experience with the Vega 56 has been very positive especially with it being a 2017 card. I would no longer recommend this card as the 5600XT is a similar price if not cheaper and will offer more value. It is also quieter, cooler with less power consumption making the Vega 56 redundant (which it should).</p>

<h2 id="corsair-vengeance-16gb-3200mhz">Corsair vengeance 16gb 3200MHz</h2>

<p><img src="assets\images\gabriels-PC\corsair_vengeance.jpg" alt="corsair ram" /></p>

<p>When I was designing my rig I knew that 16gb of RAM was the amount I needed. As they say, 8 is good but 16 is ideal. I also knew that Ryzen CPUs benefited from higher memory speeds. This is why I chose 3200MHz as it is generally accepted as the “sweet spot” when it comes to price to performance. Looking back I probably have gone for 3000MHz if it had been £10 cheaper as RAM is so easy to overclock. I got 2 sticks of 8 (of course) for that extra dual-channel performance so I can get a few extra frames. When I bought them RAM prices were extremely low – and still are – which was great and I was very pleased with it. Overall experience has been great with 0 issues as of so far including my overclocking. I am currently running them at 3600MHz which is always a nice extra. I would highly recommend this RAM to anyone doing a mid-range to low high-end build.</p>

<h2 id="b450-aorus-elite">B450 Aorus elite</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/aorus_elite.jpg" alt="b450 mdb" /></p>

<p>When it came to a motherboard I did not want to spend a large of sum money but I did want it to be fairly upgrade friendly. Luckily for me, I had chosen a AMD CPU meaning that I would not need to spend as much on a board. I decided upon a B450 as I knew that an X570 or X470 would be more expensive and I was not planning on doing a huge amount of overclocking or extreme overclocking. When it came to board features I knew that I wanted; 4 RAM slots, 2 NVME m.2 slots, and some decent IO. Taking all the factors stated above into account a settled on the B450 Aorus elite. It comes with all the things that I wanted including some RGB which we all know drastically increases gaming performance. It was originally £20 more than I was willing to spend but ended up being on a discount which meant that I bought it. The motherboard is very good and fitted my needs perfectly. It was very nice that the IO shield was pre-installed as saved some hassle. It had a generous amount of USB ports which is great for me as I end up using many of them. The audio jacks were a bit overkill for me, that being an understatement, but it was a bonus. Would recommend this to anyone that wants a board that can have an upgrade or two but does not break the bank.</p>

<h2 id="sabrent-rocket-nvme-pcie-m2-2280-512gb">Sabrent Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 512gb</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/sabrent_rocket.jpg" alt="sabrent rocket" /></p>

<p>When I was choosing and SSD I wanted something fast and was willing to compromise some storage for a faster one. I originally was going to get a Western Digital blue 500gb as it was decently fast and still an NVMe drive. I ordered it and just before it arrived Henry found a much faster SSD for the same price with brilliant reviews on Amazon. It was the Sabrent rocket NVMe SSD. I ended up cancelling my order and buying the rocket instead. I am very pleased that I made this decision as my games load incredibly fast and the very small amount of extra storage is a small freebie. I also can’t let henry have a better one than me. Extremely pleased with this SSD as it hits all the advertised speeds if not higher and I have had zero issues. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has an m.2 slot which supports an NVMe drive.

<h2 id="evga-600w-80">EVGA 600W 80+</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/EVGA_PSU.jpg" alt="PSU EVGA" /></p>

<p>I knew that I needed a power supply that was at least 550w as the Vega 56 has a high power consumption. I did not want to spend too much on a power supply, as I did not mind having a non-modular power supply, although now that I can not use 2 separate 8 pins I have some regrets. I also wanted to buy from a reliable manufacturer to make sure I still had my parts in 3 months. I ended up going for an EVGA 600w for all the reasons stated above. It is rated 80+ bronze which is always nice. Unfortunately it ended up failing halfway through gaming sessions and eventually did not start at all. luckily Amazon has amazing customer service and I was able to receive a full refund. I bought a 550W Corsair which is now in the build at my mums house. I now have a 650W Corsair in this build. A good PSU for a good price, I was just unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="aerocool-cylon-mid-tower-rgb">AeroCool Cylon Mid-Tower RGB</h2>

<p><img src="assets/images/gabriels-PC/aerocool_cylon.jpg" alt="case Aerocool cylon" /></p>

<p>For my case, I decided to go cheap. I did not mind cable managing in a rough environment if it meant It gave me more budget towards other parts of the build. The only thing that was a must-have was a power supply shroud that I could shove all my spare cables into. So I decided to choose the AeroCool Cylon. The case is good for the price but the airflow is pretty bad. It has a tempered glass panel which was something that I wanted so I could see into my pc and see the RGB. The case also has an/ RGB strip that is changed by a button on the front but is not very customisable. It has one USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports. It also has a micro SD reader which could possibly be useful. It is a pretty decent case that I would recommend if you are okay with bad airflow and difficult cable management.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Overall I am very happy with my build and had a lot of fun building it. I think that mostly made the correct decisions and think that it turned out great. Gaming has never been more fun and it is nice to be part of the PC master race.</p>
