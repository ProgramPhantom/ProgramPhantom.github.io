# Starting the site

I have had some prior knowledge before making this about very basic HTML and CSS that I did in school. However most of this had been forgotten and I pretty much made it up as I went along. The new website is more like the second generation of a website that I started making about this time last year. It started as the website below and I completely changed it.

## GitHub Pages

To make the Tech Oasis website I used a very useful framework that my Dad came across a few years ago. Its called GitHub Pages and makes it much easier for anyone wanting to make a website – if its first time or your 1000th time. I set up my GitHub pages repository that came with lots of infrastructure already installed. Also I added this thing called a Jekyll theme.

## Jekyll Theme

Jekyll is a brilliant way to easily make awesome looking websites and to quickly have different pages for, say a blog, added to the site. There are lots of templates to choose from so you can pick what suits you best. 

## Local Server
Another thing I did to help me develop was to make a local server to host my website. This meant that I could quickly build it and see the changes without having to push to the repository and wait for the website to build.

# Developing

And with that, I was almost ready to start making the new website. I downloaded GitHub desktop and opened my project in VS Code.
At first, I went for the “hacker” theme because I thought it was cool. In the end however, I would go on to completely remove all the hacker-type style from the page. Cleverly, I did not check to see if there was a blank template before taking my time removing everything.

I pretty much copied my entire old website into the HTML and CSS files and made it work from there. I then went on to change it to what you see now.

## Navigation bar change

One of the biggest changes I made to the old site was a revamp of the navigation bar. I changed it to a nice dropdown with different sections and it also resizes depending on the window width. At first I followed a tutorial on W3Schools on how to make the dropdown but soon realised it would only work for a single button without getting to annoying levels of complexity. So I found a different way of doing it using entries in a list.

## Markdown
An upside to using Jekyll was it brought Markdown to my attention. Using markdown, noobs like Gabriel could easily make posts without having to touch HTML. It also showed that you can make template files that you put some markdown into, going and nicely formatting it to your specifications.

I bought the domain techoasis.org.uk from Yay.com for £6. Then, I proceeded to pointing it to my site, that was being hosted (for free!) by GitHub pages.

Thanks for reading guys and stay tuned for more updates on the website!
