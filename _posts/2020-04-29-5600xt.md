This is AMD's answer to the mid range graphics card market. Can the RX 5600 XT compete with Nvidia's 1660 Super and 1660 Ti? 

# AMD Radeon 5600 XT
Coming out on the 21st Jan 2020, the Radeon 5600 series was AMD's answer to Nvidia's domination in the £200 to £280 graphics card market.

## Pricing

 The 5600 XT at first confused enthusiasts as they thought it was supposed to compete with the £250 Nvidia GeForce 1660 Ti. However AMD opted to price it around £30 more, coming in on average at £280. 
In response to this Nvidia dropped the price of their RTX 2060 down to £300, in the form of the EVGA "KO" variant. However, the AMD card still trades blows with Nvidia's more expensive card.

## Performance 

The 5600 XT is a brilliant performer. This card could possibly become the king of 1440p gaming. Once thought to be competing with the 1660 Ti, this card blows it out of the water at most titles (admittedly being £30 more expensive). Even the RTX 2060 KO, Nvidia's response to the card, does not appear to have the upper hand.

### Specs
This card is built on AMD's new RDNA architecture, which is using a 7nm fabrication process. This means better thermals and more efficient power consumption compared to past architectures. 
Other specs:
- 36 CU (computer units)
- Clock Speed: 1375MHz base
- "Game" clock speed: 1750MHz (this is the speed the GPU can consistently reach while playing games
- Comes with 6Gb (a break from the very RAM heavy Polaris cards) of new GDDR6 memory with 192-bit memory bus.
- Typical power usage is 150-160 watts. AMD recommends at least a 450w PSU

These parts come together to make a brilliant card for the price. Beating the 2060 in most games, all while consuming less power. This card can both game in the 1440p res and 1080p, but you are pushing it when moving up to 4k. You'll probably have to turn the settings down a lot. 144hz gaming is also aced by this card, comfortably reaching  144 fps at high settings in games like Apex Legends, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch, GTA, etc. (when paired with R5 3600). See full list of game FPS according to gpucheck [here](https://github.com/ProgramPhantom/WebGenerator/invitations) 

## Launch Mess
The launch of this card was a bit of a mess. AMD last second released a new VBIOS update which considerably increased performance by upping clock speeds. This meant that not all the cards which were sold received this boost in performance so users at home had to update it manually, or risk loosing performance for their money. 
AMD did this as a response to Nvidia's 2060 KO, just to make sure it was rendered completely redundant.

## Drivers.
Well, the 2060 KO was not completely beat because of AMD's drivers, letting them down, **again**. This card is definitely not void of some stability problems. I have experienced multiple crashes and strange behaviour, even after Radeon 20.02.2 driver up date supposedly fixed these issues. Still to this day AMD still has a huge driver quality problem that is becoming more and more painful.  And still Nvidia offer quality, stable drivers. This is a big selling point of the KO over the 5600.

## Overall

This is a brilliant card from AMD, coming in and really shaking up the market. It's price point means it slips inbetween Nvidia's 1660 Ti and 2060 KO, beating both of them. If you ignore the stability issues, there is no real competition when it comes to performance to the price in this bracket.
