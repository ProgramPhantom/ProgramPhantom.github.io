When it comes to cheap, low end phones, Motorola get it right time and time again. Hey guys its tech oasis and this is the Moto G7 Power. 

# Review

## Build

The build feels nice, with polymer glass on the back. It has some weight to it and feels like a quality device. Unfortunately, there is no form of water resistance. 

The power and volume buttons are in acceptable positions, along the right side of the phone. The volume rocker could be a bit lower down though for people with smaller hands.

### Options

You can get this phone in 3 colours; Black, Blue and a very snazzy Violet colour. 

### Finger print sensor

The Moto G7 Power has a great little finger print sensor that is lightning fast and only takes a couple of hours to get used to. 

## Battery 

The stand out feature of this phone is the huge 5000 mAh battery. I’ve been using this phone for a couple of months now and the phone can comfortably last me 3 days under moderate usage. So, if you’re someone who forgets to charge, or if you have a weekend away, this phone is for you. When it does finally run out however, you can charge it up very quickly with Motorola’s TurboPower charging technology. The phone has a USB-C port at the bottom. No wireless charging here.

## Display

It has a 6.2” LCD Gorilla Glass display with a resolution of 1520 by 720. The screen is fine but not outstanding, especially when compared to a higher end OLED screen. It’s mostly bezelless having a thicker chin showing some Motorola branding at the bottom. Also don’t forget about the medium size notch at the top of the display. The screen gets quite bright but you might find it hard to see things in direct sunlight.

## Camera

On the back of the phone you’ll find a single 12 MP camera that can shoot up to 4k video (30fps).  It’s decent but is definitely a point that could be improved. The camera on the front is 8 MP and is fine for video calls.

## Speaker

The speaker is on the front next to the camera and will do for most uses but can be a bit tinny and could be higher quality. And of course, thank god, a 3.5mm headphone jack is still present on this phone.

## Software

On the software side of things, the moto G7 Power comes with almost pure stock android 9 along with some features Motorola have thrown in there. For example, the very useful camera and torch gestures. Other things include the always on screen, great for quickly checking the time and notifications, without needing to find the power button. Also Motorola have added a surprisingly good facial recognition feature that sometimes works too well. I turned it off because I want to look at notifications without unlocking my phone every time I pick it up.

## Inside

The model here has 4 GB of memory, giving the user a smooth multi-tasking experience. 64 GB of storage is a generous amount and if you find yourself running out, you can always expand with up to a 512 GB micro SD card.

As for speed, there’s absolutely no problem. It has an octa core Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 632 that runs at 1.8 gHz. This makes for a nice snappy experience that can run pretty much any app smoothly.

## Extras!

A sweet surprise for a budget phone is the included transparent case it comes with. It can do an okay job protecting your phone but doesn’t look too good and can become grimy easily. I would still consider getting a better case if you drop your phone a lot. Very nice gesture from Motorola. Further reasons to get a case is that this phone is a HUGE fingerprint magnet.

# Summary

Overall this is another outstanding budget phone from Motorola’s G line up. And, with a £180 price tag, this could possibly be the king of sub £200 phones.  We are excited to see if Motorola can continue delivering such value phones generation after generation.  

9 / 10
